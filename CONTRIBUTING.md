# How to Contribute

Thanks for your interest in contributing to `awesome-advice`! Here are a few
general guidelines on contributing and reporting bugs that we ask you to review.
Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the
contributors managing and developing this open source project. In return, they
should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and
helping you finalize your pull requests. In that spirit of mutual respect, we
endeavour to review incoming issues and pull requests within 10 days, and will
close any lingering issues or pull requests after 60 days of inactivity.

## Reporting Issues

Before reporting a new issue, please ensure that the issue was not already
reported or fixed by searching through our
[issues list](https://github.csnzoo.com/wayfair/repo_name/issues).

When creating a new issue, please be sure to include a **title and clear
description**, as much relevant information as possible, and, if possible, a
test case.

## Sending Pull Requests

Before sending a new pull request, take a look at existing pull requests and
issues to see if the proposed change or fix has been discussed in the past, or
if the change was already implemented but not yet released.

We expect new pull requests to include tests for any affected behavior, and, as
we follow semantic versioning, we may reserve breaking changes until the next
major version release.

Thanks again for your interest on contributing to `awesome-advice`!
