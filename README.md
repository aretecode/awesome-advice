### priority

#### research

#### 15 minute rule
  > general rule of thumb / proverbial saying, not 100% black-and-white, just don't be an askhole.

  - if you ask for help on a problem before doing at least 15 minutes of work researching, debugging, and defining your problem, you're doing the other person a disservice.
  - if you wait longer than 45 minutes and you are stuck, you are doing yourself a disservice.

#### proverbial
- measure twice, cut once
- there is never any code that is more permanent than temporary code
- when you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail
- if you're not using a framework, you're making one.

#### general
- design patterns - don't let the names dictate the form of your code
- expressive, clearly communicative, clean code
  - have [variable names describe their intention](https://twitter.com/svensauleau/status/856424137493008384)
- join in the community, conversing with people interested in the same thing, helping solve problems & getting your problems solved
- don't worry if you think it sucks, contributing open source code helps build important skills, practice makes permanent

#### performance
- premature optimization is the root of all evil
- make it debuggable
- ensure that the micro-optimizations are really things to optimize if they may do less benefit and cause more negatives than obvious ones
- [benchmark](https://github.com/aretecode/bench-chain)

#### always
- good apis
