## Priority
- The better the problem is defined, the better the solution will be

## Research
- #1. most important thing in programming is knowing how to research.
- #2. is research.
- #3. is research.

## 15 minute rule
  > general rule of thumb / proverbial saying, not 100% black-and-white, just don't be an askhole.

  - If you ask for help on a problem before doing at least 15 minutes of work researching, debugging, and defining your problem, you're doing the other person a disservice.
  - If you wait longer than 45 minutes and you are stuck, you are doing yourself a disservice.

## Proverbial
- Measure twice, cut once
- There is never any code that is more permanent than temporary code
- When you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail
- If you're not using a framework, you're making one.

## General
- Design patterns: don't let the names dictate the form of your code
- Expressive, clearly communicative, clean code
  - Have [variable names describe their intention](https://twitter.com/svensauleau/status/856424137493008384)
- Join in the community, conversing with people interested in the same thing, helping solve problems & getting your problems solved
- Don't worry if you think it sucks, contributing open source code helps build important skills, practice makes permanent
- Muscle memory is 10x more effective than memorization: study, but don't forget to _exercise_ your learning

- [Backwards compatibility is for suckers](http://blog.ircmaxell.com/2013/06/backwards-compatibility-is-for-suckers.html)

## Performance
- Premature optimization is the root of all evil
- Make it debuggable
- Ensure that the micro-optimizations are really things to optimize if they may do less benefit and cause more negatives than obvious ones
- [Benchmark](https://github.com/aretecode/bench-chain)

## Always
- Good APIs
- Schema validation
- Good http transactions
- Simple DBs
